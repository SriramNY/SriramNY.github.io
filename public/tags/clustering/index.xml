      <description>Medoidsthese are representative objects whose average dissimilarity of all the objects in the cluster in minimal.they are always restricted to be members of the data set.are most commonly used on data when a mean or centroid cannot be defined, such as graphs.for some datasets there may be more than one medoids.more details here
PAM Algorithm\[F(x) = minimize \sum_{i=1}^{n}\sum_{j=1}^{n} d(i,j) z_{i,j}\] where, F(x) is the function to minimize, d(i,j) is the dissimilarity measurement between the entities i and j, Z(ij - subscript) variable that ensures that only the dissimilarity between entities from the same cluster will be compiter in the main function,</description>
